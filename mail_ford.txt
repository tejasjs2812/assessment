Subject- Vehicle Complain

Hi, 
I Ajinkya Dak owner of Ecosport [ Vehicle Number- MH 14 GS 6677]. 
I understand I am entitled to expect the things I buy are of acceptable quality, and are provided with acceptable warranty. 
But recent happenings have me baffled and are making me wonder if I have purchased New vehicle or have I  been Folled by ford.
Its been around 18 months from purchase, and I had to take vehicle to service centre several times.

Enlisting problems occured So far and got them corrected from Servicing Centre- 

1. Several Scratches on Disc Brake
2. AC Fan wasn't working properly due to lose connection.
3. on completing Just 53K km running, Turbo went out. 
   I was with family, 350km away from servicing centre and at night. They took the car with them and took 7 days to repair. 
   Meanwhile no car was provided by them for minor usage. 
  
I am sure you will agree that in view of the above problems the vehicle was not of a reasonable standard.I am prepared to accept a repair of the vehicle at no cost to me.
If repairs can be completed quickly But I influenced my friends and family members to trsut Ford to buy Endeavour [ vehicle numbers: MH 12 RS 0900, MH 44 S 0004] 
but even they are disappointed with the performance and service.

AS an user, I am deeply disappointed with the vehicle performance and demand explanation from you. 
I am also planning to take this to consumer court because of quality issues. 

I hope you consider this on priority and Revert back soon. 

Regards, 
Ajinkya
